In this repository, you will find two plugins developed in PHP for the Moodle platform.

The plugins provide the following features:

1 List all the teachers and advisors in a course.  

2 Modify the block's configuration based on user roles.

3 Send messages to teachers and advisors.\n


Example:

Below is an image of the teacher block. In the example, we can see that two teachers are displayed in the block. If the role of a course participant is changed to "Teacher," their name will appear in the block after refreshing the page.

<div aling="center"> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8aaae3e-a500-439c-a697-595089a5ff51)</div>

We will change the role of the participant to teacher
