In this repository, you will find two plugins developed in PHP for the Moodle platform.

The plugins provide the following features:

1. List all the teachers and advisors in a course.  
2. Modify the block's configuration based on user roles.  
3. Send messages to teachers and advisors.

Example:


Below is an image of the teacher block. In the example, we can see that two teachers are displayed in the block. If the role of a course participant is changed to "Teacher," their name will appear in the block after refreshing the page.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8aaae3e-a500-439c-a697-595089a5ff51" alt="Teacher Block 1" width="500">
</div>


We will change the role of the participant to teacher.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15451e0e-54b2-4eb1-b1d6-5a375f2aa8a7" alt="Teacher Block 2" width="500">
</div>


Now we will see how the new teacher is displayed in the teacher block.
